Launch website builder Launch builder (signup or cc not required) Frequently Asked Questions: How much does it cost? There are only 2 plans: Forever Free and Hosted plan. Except the small branding, there is absolutely no difference in free and paid plans. For just $39 one-time fee you can upgrade to a paid plan to get rid of the branding (your money helps to pay for the development and hosting). You can also download the HTML code in the free version and host it on your own servers without our branding. We also support instant deployment on SFTP, Aws S3, Github, Netlify, etc. What was the motivation behind creating this site? Here are the top reasons: 1. Free as in free beer. Many builders won\\'t allow HTML export until you pay first, and even after that your data is held hostage and tied to their website. I wanted to make something where you own everything including the HTML files, your project data including the website builder source code itself. 2. Targeted towards developers: As the website name suggests this web builder targets tech savvy people. So while the builder is mostly WYSIWYG, it is possible to do advanced stuff like writing your own custom CSS, create custom classes, etc! 3. No crippling restrictions. My goal is for you to create beautiful sites and I will not put any restrictions on paid or free plans and what you can do with this site (within reasonable limits). I do appreciate some credit like some word of mouth if you are using the free version to create your websites. 4. Clean HTML Code: Web builders often generate div soups and absolutely positioned elements. This is not good for readability, SEO or mobile rendering. All code generated by this builder is 100% clean bootstrap compatible code which you can read and edit by hand if needed. 5. Missing features. My plan is to clean up the code and release this as an open-source project so you can extend this project in any way you like. The whole design is super modular and it takes about 10 minutes to create a new component (with Vue 3). I plan to do this by the end of this year (2022). If it\\'s free.. How do you make money? The hosted version contains a small branding. To get rid of our branding you can pay a small one-time fee of $39. Can I export HTML for Free? Yes all users including Free plan users can download the HTML directly as a zip file to host the website on your own servers. If you\\'re a developer you will be happy to know about our Github integration , which makes it possible to push the HTML files directly to a Github repo (and deploy it to your own servers using Github Actions too) What are the restrictions in Free plan? You can make unlimited websites with unlimited pages. There are absolutely no restrictions as long as your website is in compliance with our AUP. Can I add a blog or CMS to my website? Yes adding a blog or support articles is super easy to your website and fully supported. Can I host sites on my own servers? Yes you can export the HTML code and host it on your own server too. We also offer a \"Github Actions\" integration which makes it possible to push the HTML files directly to your github repo and deploy it to Amazon S3, SFTP, etc automatically. Can I see a demo without registering? You can try all the features and even download HTML files without filling any registration forms. Does it have multi-lingual support? Yes you can switch the website language inside the builder to add support for multiple languages. Elements that do not have a translation added to them will fallback to the default \\'English\\' text. Do I need to learn programming like HTML or CSS to use this? No need to do any coding. This a 100% no-code drag-n-drop website builder. But if you are a developer then you can use some advanced features like inline CSS, Custom HTML code widget, etc. Who owns the websites I create here? You own everything you create. You can also export everything including HTML, project source code (JSON), website assets, etc in a zip file. My plan is to open-source this site in the coming months so you can run this offline and nobody can keep your data hostage. This was one of the main motivations behind creating this website. Bootstrap site is a free no code landing page and website maker. Create unlimited websites and landing pages and host them for Free.

Many free CMS tools offer entry-level features that get more powerful as you upgrade to premium editions. What are the main features of a CMS platform? CMS platforms come with everything you need to build and manage a website. This can include tools for content editing, like HubSpot‚Äôs drag-and-drop page editor, and tools for designing the entire look and feel of your website, like our flexible themes. As a SaaS CMS, you‚Äôll also have access to HubSpot‚Äôs premium hosting, providing you with an easy way to get started with your website. A CMS platform will also include tools to help you report on the success of your website, like HubSpot‚Äôs website analytics dashboard. What is the difference between a CMS and a CRM? Though \"CMS\" and \"CRM\" sound similar, they are not the same thing. A CMS is the platform that enables you to build, edit, and host your website. A CRM (customer relationship management) is software for organizing and connecting with your organization\\'s prospects, leads, and contacts. The best CMS is one that integrates seamlessly with your CRM, allowing you to generate leads and turn those leads into customers all in one place. Do I need a developer to use HubSpot‚Äôs free CMS tools? Not at all. Thanks to features like our flexible themes and drag-and-drop page editor, you can get started with HubSpot‚Äôs CMS tools without any technical skills. As your website\\'s needs become more advanced, and you want more complex or customized web elements, you can still work with a developer to get the most out of Content Hub and the rest of the HubSpot customer platform.

Our payments tool allows qualified US customers to add payment links directly to any website built with Content Hub, making it easy to securely generate revenue off your website. \\xa0And, if you‚Äôre already using Shopify for your ecommerce store, you can leverage our Shopify integration for a seamless integration between the two platforms.

Launch website builder Launch builder (signup or cc not required) Frequently Asked Questions: How much does it cost? There are only 2 plans: Forever Free and Hosted plan. Except the small branding, there is absolutely no difference in free and paid plans. For just $39 one-time fee you can upgrade to a paid plan to get rid of the branding (your money helps to pay for the development and hosting). You can also download the HTML code in the free version and host it on your own servers without our branding. We also support instant deployment on SFTP, Aws S3, Github, Netlify, etc. What was the motivation behind creating this site? Here are the top reasons: 1. Free as in free beer. Many builders won\\'t allow HTML export until you pay first, and even after that your data is held hostage and tied to their website. I wanted to make something where you own everything including the HTML files, your project data including the website builder source code itself. 2. Targeted towards developers: As the website name suggests this web builder targets tech savvy people. So while the builder is mostly WYSIWYG, it is possible to do advanced stuff like writing your own custom CSS, create custom classes, etc! 3. No crippling restrictions. My goal is for you to create beautiful sites and I will not put any restrictions on paid or free plans and what you can do with this site (within reasonable limits). I do appreciate some credit like some word of mouth if you are using the free version to create your websites. 4. Clean HTML Code: Web builders often generate div soups and absolutely positioned elements. This is not good for readability, SEO or mobile rendering. All code generated by this builder is 100% clean bootstrap compatible code which you can read and edit by hand if needed. 5. Missing features. My plan is to clean up the code and release this as an open-source project so you can extend this project in any way you like. The whole design is super modular and it takes about 10 minutes to create a new component (with Vue 3). I plan to do this by the end of this year (2022). If it\\'s free.. How do you make money? The hosted version contains a small branding. To get rid of our branding you can pay a small one-time fee of $39. Can I export HTML for Free? Yes all users including Free plan users can download the HTML directly as a zip file to host the website on your own servers. If you\\'re a developer you will be happy to know about our Github integration , which makes it possible to push the HTML files directly to a Github repo (and deploy it to your own servers using Github Actions too) What are the restrictions in Free plan? You can make unlimited websites with unlimited pages. There are absolutely no restrictions as long as your website is in compliance with our AUP. Can I add a blog or CMS to my website? Yes adding a blog or support articles is super easy to your website and fully supported. Can I host sites on my own servers? Yes you can export the HTML code and host it on your own server too. We also offer a \"Github Actions\" integration which makes it possible to push the HTML files directly to your github repo and deploy it to Amazon S3, SFTP, etc automatically. Can I see a demo without registering? You can try all the features and even download HTML files without filling any registration forms. Does it have multi-lingual support? Yes you can switch the website language inside the builder to add support for multiple languages. Elements that do not have a translation added to them will fallback to the default \\'English\\' text. Do I need to learn programming like HTML or CSS to use this? No need to do any coding. This a 100% no-code drag-n-drop website builder. But if you are a developer then you can use some advanced features like inline CSS, Custom HTML code widget, etc. Who owns the websites I create here? You own everything you create. You can also export everything including HTML, project source code (JSON), website assets, etc in a zip file. My plan is to open-source this site in the coming months so you can run this offline and nobody can keep your data hostage. This was one of the main motivations behind creating this website. Bootstrap site is a free no code landing page and website maker. Create unlimited websites and landing pages and host them for Free.

Have just been researching for‚Ä¶ Responsive website builder Which can publish a site to where I want it ‚Ä¶but I guess you knew that ;-) Yours looks like the thing! Nice and simple to use. And feels solid and reliable. Count me in if you need any testers. Tanya K. I just installed this web design software. You caught me at a good time as I am redoing my home page to make it better for mobile at my website. I previously used a template based on skel which I was told was more light weight than Bootstrap but I find it to be less functional than it should be so I am trying to develop a Bootstrap version now. Kevin O. What a great start! My creative graphic designers mind is already thinking of ways around the limited design options to create the unique looks I want for my clients using the background image option. I\\'m excited to see where you go with this new project. Julie C. Loving the additions to the new version of your website development app. It\\'s a great, cleanly designed, user-friendly, non-bloated web design program, comparing wix, weebly, squarespace... So easy and a pleasure to use. I\\'m with you all the way with this wonderful project. Keep up the great work on this easy website builder. David F. I thinks the world of Web development is becoming easier and easier but it\\'s also making it harder for guys like me to find work because so many people want to use out-of-the-box responsive layout sites that are easy to implement and launch. I personally would much rather make a site from scratch than use a template. The app is quite cool though as it provides a drag and drop interface that can create decent looking and original websites that has a mobile website design as well. Ian G. I am very happy that you guys released this, not only it is a great idea it was executed properly. I will use this to build a basic site for a customer. i looked at the video and demo sites and was very happy with what could be done. I would really like to add more widgets to your website builder software. I am confident that you will be at the top of the market if you add more functionality without loosing intuitiveness! What makes products like this great is many features but so easy to use Thanks! Rajat Sh. We needed a simple open source web site creation tool. We needed to quickly and easily get an attractive web site. We needed to do all of this without having to work through a ‚Äúdeveloper.‚Äù And, since 1995, I and millions of others have been living in frustration, because that tool has never, ever existed. Never. This tool is the holy grail, a flying unicorn‚Ä¶ the loch ness monster‚Ä¶ rare and amazing, and something nobody has ever actually seen. Jeffrey G. Hallo, Your program is one of the best website builder software I have tried to build a simple but effective websites, everything is fine, I even began to outline our new corporate and multiple product-oriented responsive websites! Igor Grandiose!!!! Best website builder software - testing under an hour and hooked me. While it is a great alternative for designers who are with short time and produce things for small customers. PixelsArts I had a quick 30 minute look at your software and liked the way it is so responsive. I especially liked the way you could change the view from mobile through tablet and then desktop. best wishes Cavan S. I just wanted to tell you how much I love your product ‚Äî after coding sites since 1999 ‚Äî I can have a world class landing page or simple site up in minutes. I‚Äôm having a freaking blast using this product of yours! :-) I am a perfect user for this Simple Website Builder, as I am that entrepreneur, the guy needing to frequently put up great web pages and small sites for new ideas, products, events, etc. in the course of running my busy business. Coding dumdums like me all over the world will flock to your AI software by the thousands and thousands for such a drag and drop platform for producing gorgeous, responsive, static sites with truly ZERO coding. Jack C. As someone who came to web design from graphic design I work visually & use WYSIWYG website builders with some limited code knowledge - enough to do some minor editing, insert code into head/body etc but that\\'s about it. However the spectre of responsive web design has been weighing on my mind of late, even though I can & do create dedicated mobile websites it is a lot more work, although I do prefer the look of dedicated pages as responsive tend to be quite plain & all the same. But I know having a responsive option would be a good thing to be able to offer if I get clients that want it. Your Mobirise is the first responsive web builder software I have seen that is actually easy so importantly - intuitive!! Thanks!\" Julie M. I am really impressed with the work put into creating this nice website program. I love the ease with which Websites can be built in a few minutes using this awesome product. I like the intuitive drag and drop process and the mobile-first approach. I love this product, but it seems incapable of creating corporate Websites, because of the simple designs. Generally, I want to commend you for your work. The product is awesome. With more block options, increased flexibility, Mobirise Website Maker would favorably compete with the top website builder sofware - squarespace, godaddy, wix, weebly and probably - wordpress! I\\'ll be standing by. Your product has great potential. Keep working. Chinoms U.

Create your next landing page for free in just 5 mins or less. Then publish it on your own custom domains with Free SSL hosting to start generating leads and traffic. Launch website builder Launch builder (signup or cc not required) Frequently Asked Questions: How much does it cost? There are only 2 plans: Forever Free and Hosted plan. Except the small branding, there is absolutely no difference in free and paid plans. For just $39 one-time fee you can upgrade to a paid plan to get rid of the branding (your money helps to pay for the development and hosting). You can also download the HTML code in the free version and host it on your own servers without our branding. We also support instant deployment on SFTP, Aws S3, Github, Netlify, etc. What was the motivation behind creating this site? Here are the top reasons: 1. Free as in free beer. Many builders won\\'t allow HTML export until you pay first, and even after that your data is held hostage and tied to their website. I wanted to make something where you own everything including the HTML files, your project data including the website builder source code itself. 2. Targeted towards developers: As the website name suggests this web builder targets tech savvy people. So while the builder is mostly WYSIWYG, it is possible to do advanced stuff like writing your own custom CSS, create custom classes, etc! 3. No crippling restrictions. My goal is for you to create beautiful sites and I will not put any restrictions on paid or free plans and what you can do with this site (within reasonable limits). I do appreciate some credit like some word of mouth if you are using the free version to create your websites. 4. Clean HTML Code: Web builders often generate div soups and absolutely positioned elements. This is not good for readability, SEO or mobile rendering. All code generated by this builder is 100% clean bootstrap compatible code which you can read and edit by hand if needed. 5. Missing features. My plan is to clean up the code and release this as an open-source project so you can extend this project in any way you like. The whole design is super modular and it takes about 10 minutes to create a new component (with Vue 3). I plan to do this by the end of this year (2022). If it\\'s free.. How do you make money? The hosted version contains a small branding. To get rid of our branding you can pay a small one-time fee of $39. Can I export HTML for Free? Yes all users including Free plan users can download the HTML directly as a zip file to host the website on your own servers. If you\\'re a developer you will be happy to know about our Github integration , which makes it possible to push the HTML files directly to a Github repo (and deploy it to your own servers using Github Actions too) What are the restrictions in Free plan? You can make unlimited websites with unlimited pages. There are absolutely no restrictions as long as your website is in compliance with our AUP. Can I add a blog or CMS to my website? Yes adding a blog or support articles is super easy to your website and fully supported. Can I host sites on my own servers? Yes you can export the HTML code and host it on your own server too. We also offer a \"Github Actions\" integration which makes it possible to push the HTML files directly to your github repo and deploy it to Amazon S3, SFTP, etc automatically. Can I see a demo without registering? You can try all the features and even download HTML files without filling any registration forms. Does it have multi-lingual support? Yes you can switch the website language inside the builder to add support for multiple languages. Elements that do not have a translation added to them will fallback to the default \\'English\\' text. Do I need to learn programming like HTML or CSS to use this? No need to do any coding. This a 100% no-code drag-n-drop website builder. But if you are a developer then you can use some advanced features like inline CSS, Custom HTML code widget, etc. Who owns the websites I create here? You own everything you create. You can also export everything including HTML, project source code (JSON), website assets, etc in a zip file. My plan is to open-source this site in the coming months so you can run this offline and nobody can keep your data hostage. This was one of the main motivations behind creating this website. Bootstrap site is a free no code landing page and website maker. Create unlimited websites and landing pages and host them for Free.

Have just been researching for‚Ä¶ Responsive website builder Which can publish a site to where I want it ‚Ä¶but I guess you knew that ;-) Yours looks like the thing! Nice and simple to use. And feels solid and reliable. Count me in if you need any testers. Tanya K. I just installed this web design software. You caught me at a good time as I am redoing my home page to make it better for mobile at my website. I previously used a template based on skel which I was told was more light weight than Bootstrap but I find it to be less functional than it should be so I am trying to develop a Bootstrap version now. Kevin O. What a great start! My creative graphic designers mind is already thinking of ways around the limited design options to create the unique looks I want for my clients using the background image option. I\\'m excited to see where you go with this new project. Julie C. Loving the additions to the new version of your website development app. It\\'s a great, cleanly designed, user-friendly, non-bloated web design program, comparing wix, weebly, squarespace... So easy and a pleasure to use. I\\'m with you all the way with this wonderful project. Keep up the great work on this easy website builder. David F. I thinks the world of Web development is becoming easier and easier but it\\'s also making it harder for guys like me to find work because so many people want to use out-of-the-box responsive layout sites that are easy to implement and launch. I personally would much rather make a site from scratch than use a template. The app is quite cool though as it provides a drag and drop interface that can create decent looking and original websites that has a mobile website design as well. Ian G. I am very happy that you guys released this, not only it is a great idea it was executed properly. I will use this to build a basic site for a customer. i looked at the video and demo sites and was very happy with what could be done. I would really like to add more widgets to your website builder software. I am confident that you will be at the top of the market if you add more functionality without loosing intuitiveness! What makes products like this great is many features but so easy to use Thanks! Rajat Sh. We needed a simple open source web site creation tool. We needed to quickly and easily get an attractive web site. We needed to do all of this without having to work through a ‚Äúdeveloper.‚Äù And, since 1995, I and millions of others have been living in frustration, because that tool has never, ever existed. Never. This tool is the holy grail, a flying unicorn‚Ä¶ the loch ness monster‚Ä¶ rare and amazing, and something nobody has ever actually seen. Jeffrey G. Hallo, Your program is one of the best website builder software I have tried to build a simple but effective websites, everything is fine, I even began to outline our new corporate and multiple product-oriented responsive websites! Igor Grandiose!!!! Best website builder software - testing under an hour and hooked me. While it is a great alternative for designers who are with short time and produce things for small customers. PixelsArts I had a quick 30 minute look at your software and liked the way it is so responsive. I especially liked the way you could change the view from mobile through tablet and then desktop. best wishes Cavan S. I just wanted to tell you how much I love your product ‚Äî after coding sites since 1999 ‚Äî I can have a world class landing page or simple site up in minutes. I‚Äôm having a freaking blast using this product of yours! :-) I am a perfect user for this Simple Website Builder, as I am that entrepreneur, the guy needing to frequently put up great web pages and small sites for new ideas, products, events, etc. in the course of running my busy business. Coding dumdums like me all over the world will flock to your AI software by the thousands and thousands for such a drag and drop platform for producing gorgeous, responsive, static sites with truly ZERO coding. Jack C. As someone who came to web design from graphic design I work visually & use WYSIWYG website builders with some limited code knowledge - enough to do some minor editing, insert code into head/body etc but that\\'s about it. However the spectre of responsive web design has been weighing on my mind of late, even though I can & do create dedicated mobile websites it is a lot more work, although I do prefer the look of dedicated pages as responsive tend to be quite plain & all the same. But I know having a responsive option would be a good thing to be able to offer if I get clients that want it. Your Mobirise is the first responsive web builder software I have seen that is actually easy so importantly - intuitive!! Thanks!\" Julie M. I am really impressed with the work put into creating this nice website program. I love the ease with which Websites can be built in a few minutes using this awesome product. I like the intuitive drag and drop process and the mobile-first approach. I love this product, but it seems incapable of creating corporate Websites, because of the simple designs. Generally, I want to commend you for your work. The product is awesome. With more block options, increased flexibility, Mobirise Website Maker would favorably compete with the top website builder sofware - squarespace, godaddy, wix, weebly and probably - wordpress! I\\'ll be standing by. Your product has great potential. Keep working. Chinoms U.
